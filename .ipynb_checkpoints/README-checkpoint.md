here are almost all the notebooks I made and kept during my studies, 
I've sorted them by degree,  



There are a few assignments, and quite a few anecdotal notebooks made by myself to help me understand certain mathematical exercises (interpolation, integration ...)

I've tried to contextualise some of them using markdowns.

Enjoy your reading!
